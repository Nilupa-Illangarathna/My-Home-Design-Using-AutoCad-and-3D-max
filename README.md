# My-Home-Design-Using-AutoCad-and-3D-max

## This project was done leisurely. Not actually a project. A few years back(Before selecting to the University of Sri Jayewardenepura). I went through a small playlist of Cad drawings, In it, some basic idea was there about how to design and model things. So This is my first design. Actually, this is my home. The roof design and the top floor design is a bit different compared to my actual home. But all other parts are the same and the dimensions are precisely correct.
