# My-Home-Design-Using-AutoCad-and-3D-max

## All cad files with blocks and purged cad file is in the repository. The 3D max file is also included with added materials.

### This project was done leisurely. Not actually a project. A few years back(Before selecting to the University of Sri Jayewardenepura). I went through a small playlist of Cad drawings, In it, some basic idea was there about how to design and model things. So This is my first design(I assume I did a pretty good job in this since this is my first attempt at cad designing). Actually, this is my home. The roof design and the top floor design is a bit different compared to my actual home. But all other parts are the same and the dimensions are precisely correct.
